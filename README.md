Completely screw over OneShot's dialogue and play OneShot the way absolutely no one wanted you to!

## How to use
1. Download and unzip the latest version at the [Releases](https://github.com/notsuu/OneshotStringRandomizer/releases) tab
2. Make sure you have [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48) or newer installed on your computer
3. Go to the unzipped folder and run the app
4. Specify your OneShot installation path and choose whether to enable or disable some options
5. Hit the randomize button and watch it mess everything up
6. Once done, restart OneShot if it's already running, open the settings, and select whatever language you will get as a result of this
## Known issues
- Sometimes (and i assume because the message is too long), when displaying a randomized string as a desktop message, the game will crash with the 'nil cant be coerced into integer' error. **Temporary solution:** Re-randomize, restart game, hope for the best.
## Your code is bad
Ok, make an [issue](https://github.com/notsuu/OneshotStringRandomizer/issues) if its a bug or something, i dont know
## What about Linux?
I dont know, it might run under Wine, might not, check for yourself
